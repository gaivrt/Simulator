I have talked to my father about many problems related to my difficulties in junior high school, but he said that if I don't listen, he will come and hit me. I had a fight with my mother before...

However, there are many students from my previous class in this class, so I don't have any companions. I go to school alone, go home alone, and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner alone. I feel very overwhelmed and aggrieved every day. I am full of negative energy every day and feel very suppressed. Starting next week, we will have evening self-study, which adds even more pressure. On Monday, we also have flag-raising ceremony, and I am really afraid of physical education class and flag-raising ceremony. When we line up, I am the only one returning to the classroom. Others walk hand in hand in pairs, which makes me feel a huge gap and makes me feel embarrassed when I meet my previous friends. Just the thought of having to endure this kind of pain for another year makes me feel on the verge of collapse. I often become sensitive and cry secretly at midnight. This makes me really hate going to school now. I have even thought about leaving, but I feel guilty towards my family. I am really in pain... How can I regulate my emotions?",

I could play with other children and didn't talk much, but I would listen when others talked to me and follow them wherever they wanted to go. As I grew older, it was more or less the same, except that I occasionally responded with more than just nodding or shaking my head. I would do whatever others asked me to do, but I wouldn't want to start the next thing until the previous one was finished. For example, when I was doing homework for the previous class and the next class started, I wouldn't immediately stop writing and would insist on finishing the homework at hand. Later on, I gradually became able to communicate normally with friends, but if I had to communicate all the time, I couldn't bear it and wanted to escape.

I can only fall asleep reluctantly in the early morning and start tutoring at 6 am as if nothing happened. But every time I eat, I have a loss of appetite. I don't like eating as much as before. Although I was overweight when I was young, now I have a normal weight. But I realize the seriousness of the problem. I tried to communicate with my family, but they don't believe what I say. I told them that I'm normal, I just want to be like other girls, at least I can look at my face in the mirror without being scolded by them for being vain. Otherwise, I wouldn't be like this. I like to lock myself in my room, listen to instrumental music, and stay away from the 'worldly' things. Sometimes, I feel relieved when I go out for tutoring. I'm afraid of falling into the abyss.

I would also worry about a test and feel distressed. If I did well, I would feel like I used up all my luck and that I would definitely not do well on the high school entrance exam. I am also easily influenced by the negative emotions or behaviors of those around me. I have tried to break free from this circle and change my environment, but my situation is very awkward. My good friends are all negative, but they believe in themselves very much, while I often doubt myself. I know I have some insecurities, but I wasn't like this in seventh and eighth grade. I don't know how to regain my confidence and become as self-assured as before. I tend to feel down for a long time after a small incident or setback, and it even affects my sleep at night.

Recently, I feel signs of it reappearing, and I am quite worried.) It seems like I intentionally lower my emotions, deliberately pushing them down. In this state, I would like to read some popular science articles about diseases, deliberately picking out symptoms similar to mine, and then feel sorry for myself while looking at these symptoms. I intentionally make myself appear very weak, helpless, sad, and disgusted with the world, and I want to get sick. I deliberately imitate the symptoms of some mental illnesses. I think this may be because I have severe negative perfectionism and want to avoid the crazy self-criticism in my heart. Also, in this 'out of control' state, I don't have to meet my high standards. Additionally, this state may allow me to gain some sympathy. I am not very clear about the specific reasons for this state, and I am not sure if my analysis is correct. Can anyone give me some solutions? I don't want to fall into this state, I don't want to be controlled by this state, and I don't want to become the old me with low self-esteem and a victim mentality.",

But yesterday, when I was in an elevator and there was a boy next to me, I felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable. I felt this way because I wore a dress yesterday, which I rarely wear, and I felt very uncomfortable in the mall. Also, I don't dare to look people in the eye when talking to the opposite sex, and I often feel insecure about my appearance (although I'm not that ugly).

This time, he said he would come to my hometown to visit. The first day was fine, but later on, he would argue with me over trivial matters. Even his friends felt that he was not the person they knew. He would say something against me just for the sake of it. For example, he argued with me about the food we ate at the scenic spot, claiming that it was not authentic and arguing for a long time. He even said that I should ask him if I want to buy cola because he knows where to get it for 2 yuan. I didn't understand what he was saying, and it made me feel unlucky. What should I do? I feel that our relationship is not good. You won't even think about visiting me anymore.",

I have tried to change, and I have written letters to my parents and written poems, hoping that someone will understand me. Sometimes I even post my poems online, hoping to be understood. Every time they finish reading my letters or poems, they say, 'I am deeply moved; we understand; I even shed tears...' But, in reality, it's just empty words. The next day, everything is the same. I have tried almost every method, but none of them work. Every time my parents argue with me, my heart feels broken, but I endure it until they leave or I hide in the bathroom and cry, silently and tearlessly.

At that time, I went to another room to put something away, and I told her to wait a moment because I hadn't finished yet. But she asked me sarcastically if a moment meant next year or the next life. I hadn't finished putting things away when she rushed over and slapped me. I got angry and argued with her, but she likes to bring up past issues. She even joined my father in physically abusing me.

I have never lived in a dormitory before, and high school is even farther away from home. I need to live in the dormitory, and I have experienced dormitory life before due to strict management during the epidemic in junior high school. At that time, I really missed home and cried every day. I also saw that my dormitory mates were not homesick at all, and I wished there was someone to talk to me. But they were more mature and said that I was too childish. So I could only call my mom every day, sometimes three times a day. I know it's not good to do this, but I really can't control myself. Finally, I couldn't stand it anymore and went to find my homeroom teacher. The teacher allowed me to use WeChat to video call my mom. I am about to enter high school now, and I used to go home once a week. So I am worried about whether I will feel homesick and how to control myself. Can someone with experience share how to control oneself when feeling homesick? Thank you.",
